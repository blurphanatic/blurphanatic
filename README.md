Building next-gen carbon markets and supply chain traceability. DLT geek who's spent 20 years in financial market infrastructure - the plumbing that moves trillions daily.

## The Work

**Now** - Developing data-driven carbon tracking systems on Hedera. If you can't measure it, you can't trade it, and current carbon markets are built on spreadsheets and trust. That needs to change.

**Policy + Tech** - I've sat on both sides. Co-authored EU crypto regulation (MiCA) at the European Commission. Technical advisor to Bank of England on CBDC architecture. You can't build things regulators will kill, and you can't write policy without knowing what's actually possible.

**FMI Background** - Head of Digital Asset Innovation at LSEG (the London Stock Exchange, LCH clearing, FTSE Russell). Before that, 10 years at CME Group building derivatives infrastructure. I know how markets actually work.

**Standards** - Technical Advisor at OASIS-Open. Chair of UBL Commodities. Currently contributing to CEN postal digitization standards. Standards are boring until you realize they're how the world agrees on anything.

## The Approach

I treat AI like I treat any tool - it's not magic, it's leverage. Garbage in, garbage out. The output is only as good as your prompts, your training data, and your ability to know when it's bullshitting you.

Most of my repos are private or live in enterprise orgs. What's public here is home lab experiments - MCP servers, automation scripts, things I build because I want them to exist.

## Background

CS and Spanish Linguistics from Illinois State. Chicago to London. I build things.
