## üß† About Me

CTO & Head of Product. I build, scale, and instrument high-leverage systems‚Äîaligning technical debt with velocity, and treating products as feedback-enabled composable platforms. My domain spans distributed architecture, observability, API/ML infrastructure, financial systems design, and strategic automation. I assume context, cut noise, and optimize for signal across both code and org design. Execution is structured flow; alignment is the vector.

## ‚ú® Fun Facts

- Bilingual / polyglot thinker‚ÄîEnglish & Spanish, fluent in system-level abstraction.  
- London base with a global remit; travel and music are cognitive reset levers.  
- Daily practice: flow optimization, communication as signal shaping, and applying the 7 Habits in execution.  
- View technology as leverage; alignment determines direction and magnitude.  

## üß∞ Signature Capabilities

- **Systems & Product Synthesis:** From ambiguity to high-throughput execution; composable product feedback loops.  
- **Observability & Instrumentation:** Metrics-first design, signal extraction, automated alerting aligned to business outcomes.  
- **Financial & API Infrastructure:** Building resilient, audit-ready, latency-conscious systems for money and data flow.  
- **Scaling Complex Platforms:** Strategic technical debt management, feature gating, rollout orchestration.  
- **Communication as Code:** Treating org structure, docs, and feedback as first-class programmatic inputs to optimize leverage.

## üöÄ What I‚Äôm Working On / Focus Areas

- Building internal platform observability layers that collapse signal-to-decision latency.  
- Automating high-leverage product feedback loops linking user telemetry to discrete iteration outcomes.  
- Financial system resilience: reconciliation, API throughput shaping, and drift detection.  
- Org-level alignment tooling: surfaces misalignments before they cost cycles.
